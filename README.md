## Hallo!
I'm a software engineer student at ETS with a passion for graphics rendering and linux.

### Current projects:
- **Sphere**  
  Using vulkan, sdl3, entt and a couple other libraries, I'm working on rendering 3D models with PBR materials and accurate lighting. My goal is to get to ray tracing and HDR someday.

- **Singularity**  
  I wanted glsl shaders as my wallpaper on Linux Mint, turns out Cinnamon doesn't support that. So I repurposed it into a shadertoy shader displayer. Enjoy!

- **Linux Distribution**  
  Starting from Arch, I'm currently configuring my distro with Hyprland and widget systems. The goal is to support HDR.
