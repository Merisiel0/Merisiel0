## Hallo!
I'm a software engineer student at ETS with a passion for graphics rendering and linux.

### Current projects:
- **A vulkan rendering engine**  
  Using vulkan, sdl3, entt and a couple other libraries, I'm working on rendering 3D models with PBR materials and accurate lighting. My goal is to get to ray tracing someday!

- **Linux Distribution**  
  Starting from Arch, I'm currently configuring my distro with Hyprland and widget systems. The goal is to support HDR.
